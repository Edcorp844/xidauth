# X ID Authentication Service

## Overview

The **X ID Authentication Service** is a microservice designed to provide secure and efficient authentication and authorization for multiple applications and software services. It implements the OAuth 2.0 protocol, allowing users to authenticate using their existing credentials from popular identity providers like Google and Facebook. The service aims to simplify user management while enhancing security and scalability for your applications.

## Features

- **OAuth 2.0 Implementation**: Supports industry-standard authentication flows for secure access to protected resources.
- **X ID Management**: Users can create and manage their X IDs, enabling seamless access across various applications.
- **Social Login Integration**: Users can log in using their Google or Facebook accounts, providing a convenient authentication experience.
- **User Management**: Easily manage user profiles, permissions, and access levels within the service.
- **High Scalability**: Designed to handle millions of concurrent users with load balancing and caching strategies.
- **Robust Security**: Implements best practices for data protection, including encryption and secure token storage.

## Architecture

The X ID Authentication Service follows a microservices architecture, allowing for modular development and deployment. It is built using Rust for performance and safety, with Redis as the database for storing user credentials and session data.

### Key Components

- **Auth Service**: Responsible for user authentication and issuing access tokens.
- **User Database**: Stores user profiles and authentication information securely in Redis.
- **API Gateway**: Serves as a single entry point for clients to interact with the authentication service.
