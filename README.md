# X ID Authentication Service

## Overview

The **X ID Authentication Service** is a microservice designed to provide secure and efficient authentication and authorization for multiple applications and software services. It implements the OAuth 2.0 protocol, allowing applications to authenticate users using X IDs, enhancing user management while ensuring security and scalability for your applications.

## Features

- **OAuth 2.0 Implementation**: Supports industry-standard authentication flows for secure access to protected resources.
- **X ID Management**: Users can create and manage their X IDs, enabling seamless access across various applications.
- **OAuth 2.0 Provider**: Acts as an authentication provider for applications, allowing them to authenticate users securely without relying on third-party identity providers like Google or Facebook.
- **User Management**: Easily manage user profiles, permissions, and access levels within the service.
- **High Scalability**: Designed to handle millions of concurrent users with load balancing and caching strategies.
- **Robust Security**: Implements best practices for data protection, including encryption and secure token storage.

## Architecture

The X ID Authentication Service follows a microservices architecture, allowing for modular development and deployment. It is built using Rust for performance and safety, with Redis as the database for storing user credentials and session data.

### Key Components

- **Auth Service**: Responsible for user authentication and issuing access tokens.
- **User Database**: Stores user profiles and authentication information securely in Redis.
- **API Gateway**: Serves as a single entry point for clients to interact with the authentication service.
